# Construction-Site-Safety  
Ensuring a safe working environment is crucial in the construction industry, given the high level of inherent dangers and the potential for accidents. To minimize the occurrence of accidents, proactive measures for early prevention are of utmost importance.  
# What this project is about?  
The objective of this research is to reduce occupational hazards in construction sites by focusing on the inspection of safety guardrails, particularly those installed along the edges of steel decks. According to occupational safety, workplaces with edge heights exceeding two meters must have appropriate strength guardrails, covers, or other protective devices to prevent workers from falling hazards. In construction operations, steel decking is typically installed first, followed by the erection of safety guardrails. To enhance the effectiveness of safety guardrail inspections, this study proposes independent inspection models for vertical and horizontal guardrails. The inspection process involves first examining the vertical guardrails, then inspecting the edges of the steel decking, and finally assessing the horizontal guardrails.
